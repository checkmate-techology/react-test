# Fron-end Developer task 

This project is a short task meant to see how you, given a design, interact with the React project to get the expected result.


**Disclaimer**: This is not an exam, there are no right questions and nothing will be tested by hearth. You can, and are expected, to use any tool of your selection to help you solving the task.

  - `u-padding` / `u-padding--small` / `u-margin--large` / `u-padding-top--large` / `u-margin-0` / etc.

  - `t-body` / `title-1` / `title-2` ... / `title-6` / `t-subtitle`
